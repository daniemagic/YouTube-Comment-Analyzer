# Comment Analyzer
 Python script that will take the comments of your YouTube videos and use it to give you analysis in 6 different areas including: sentiment analysis, points of confusion, and suggestions for future videos.

 You can also create a pie chart showcasing the sentiments of comments as negative, neutral, or positive (as well as a word cloud!). These are quite time-consuming though as they currently work by having an LLM individually classify each one.

- Mistral (through Ollama)
